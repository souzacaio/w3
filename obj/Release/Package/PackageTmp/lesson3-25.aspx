There's so much you have to know<br>
Find a girl, settle down<br>
If you want you can marry<br>
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy<br>

I was once like you are now, and I know that it's not easy<br>
To be calm when you've found something going on<br>
But take your time, think a lot<br>
Why, think of everything you've got<br>
For you will still be here tomorrow<br>
But your dreams may not<br>

How can I try to explain<br>
Cause when I do he turns away again<br>
It's always been the same, same old story</p>

Just sit down, take it slowly<br>
You're still young, that's your fault<br>
There's so much you have to go through<br>
Find a girl, settle down<br>
If you want, you can marry<br>
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy<br>

All the times that I cried<br>
Keeping all the things I knew inside<br>
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it<br>
If they were right, I'd agree<br>
But it's them they know not me<br>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="w3-justify">
      <p>What’s America’s favorite music genre?</p>

<p>That’s an extremely difficult question to answer, with several different styles<br> resonating strongly on the touring circuit.  According to a just-released 2015 ranking 
by busbud, Country music topped the genre list for 13 different states, based on touring activity.</p>

<p>Every major tour from 2015 was factored into the analysis, then mapped that against shows in every state.</p>

<p>Country didn’t dominate the South as expected.  The music genre topped the ranking in Alabama and Arkansas, but also Hawaii, Idaho, Utah, Ohio, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Alaska, among many others.  Top-touring country artists included Luke Bryan, Jason Aldean, Shania Twain, Garth Brooks, Kenny Chesney, and Tim McGraw, among many others.</p>

  <div class="w3-third">
    <div class="w3-container w3-light-grey">
      <h2>Music News!</h2>
      <p class="w3-justify">Close behind was Classic Rock/Oldies, with mainstays like the Rolling Stones, the Who, Foreigner, U2, Rush, ZZ Top, and America keeping the flame alive.  In total, Classic Rock and Oldie as a category dominated 11 different states, all surprisingly east of the Mississippi River.</p>

    <div class="w3-container w3-light-grey w3-justify">
      <h2>Music News!</h2>
      <p class="w3-justify">In third place come the mellower sounds of Indie, a catch-all, somewhat vague category that traverses rock, folk, jam, and even electronica-infused bands.  In total, Indie topped the rankings in 10 different states, with groups like Mumford & Sons, Sleater Kinney, the Avett Brothers, and James Taylor among the top-attended artists.</p>

<h4 class="w3-lime w3-padding">GRAMMAR</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="w3-xlarge">Superlatives</p>
<p><br>
  To form the superlative, we add <strong>-est</strong> or <strong>-st </strong>to one-syllable  adjectives.<br>
  <blockquote>
  <span class="w3-wide w3-text-black">old - the oldest | warm - the warmest</span><br>
  <span class="w3-wide w3-text-black">large - the largest | wide - the widest
  </p>
  </span></blockquote>
<p><br>
  We also add <strong>-est</strong> to two-syllable adjectives ending in<strong> -y</strong> (but we  change the<strong> -y</strong> to <strong>-i</strong>).<br>
  <blockquote>
  <p>rainy - the rainiest </p>
  <p>sunny - the sunniest</p>
  </p>
  </blockquote>
<p><br>
  Sometimes with one-syllable adjectives ending in a consonant, we  double the consonant.<br>
  <blockquote class="w3-wide w3-text-black">
  big - the biggest | hot - the hottest</p>
  </blockquote>
<p><br>
  With most adjectives of two syllables or more, we use <strong>most</strong>.<br>
  <blockquote>
  <span class="w3-wide w3-text-black">interesting - the most interesting</span><br>
  <span class="w3-wide w3-text-black">exciting - the most exciting
  </p>
  </span></blockquote>
<p><br>
  <span class="w3-light-grey">Some adjectives have irregular superlative forms.</span><br>
  <blockquote>
  <span class="w3-wide w3-text-black">good - better than - the best<br>
  bad - worse than - the worst<br>
  little - less than - the least<br>
  much - more than - the most</span><br>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Country makes up the biggest part of the CD market.<br>
  Country is the most popular kind of music in the USA.<br>
  Eletronica is the least popular kind of music.<br>
  Country is the fastest growing American musical sector.</p></blockquote>

He says our  daughter Jodie has <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox69" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> ear for music and can play <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox70" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> triangle in  the school orchestra next month.<br>
  When she’s older, we would like to send her to <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox71" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> special school.<br>
  <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox72" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> school is famous for its music teaching, but Jodie doesn’t want to go  to a special music school.

    <p><span class="w3-badge w3-red">1</span>Hamlet was the only son of the King of Denmark. He loved his father and mother dearly — <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox95" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> in the love of a sweet lady named Ophelia. Her father, Polonius, was the King's Chamberlain. While Hamlet was away studying at Wittenberg, his father died. Young Hamlet hastened home in great grief to hear that a serpent had stung the King, and that he was dead. The young Prince had loved his father so tenderly that you may judge <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox96" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> when he found that the Queen, before yet the King had been laid in the ground a month, had determined to marry again—and to marry the dead King's brother. </p>

<p><span class="w3-badge w3-red">2</span>Hamlet refused to put off mourning for the wedding.  It is not only the black I wear on my body," he said, "that proves my loss. I wear mourning in my heart for my dead father. His son at least remembers him, and grieves still." Then said Claudius the King's brother, "This grief is unreasonable. Of course you must sorrow at the loss of your father, but—"  Ah," said Hamlet, bitterly, "I cannot in one little month forget those I love."  With that the Queen and Claudius left him, to make merry over their wedding, forgetting  the poor good King who had been so kind to them both.  And Hamlet, <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox97" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>, began to wonder and to question as to what he ought to do. For  he could not believe the story about the snake-bite. It seemed to him all too plain that the wicked  Claudius had killed the King, so as to get the crown and marry the Queen. Yet he had  no proof, <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox98" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> accuse Claudius. </p>

<p><span class="w3-badge w3-red">3</span> And while he was thus thinking came Horatio, a fellow student of his, from Wittenberg.  "What brought you here?" asked Hamlet, when he had greeted his friend kindly.  "I came, my lord, to see your father's funeral." "I think it was to see my mother's wedding," said Hamlet, bitterly. "My father! We shall  not look upon his like again."My lord," answered Horatio, "I <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox99" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> 
him yesternight." Then, while Hamlet listened in surprise, Horatio told how he, with two gentlemen of the guard, had seen the King's ghost on the battlements. Hamlet  went that night, and true enough, at midnight, the ghost of the King, in the armor he had  been wont to wear, appeared on the battlements in the chill moonlight. Hamlet was a brave  youth. Instead of
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox100" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> from the ghost he spoke to it — and when it beckoned him  he followed it to a quiet place, and there the ghost told him that what he had suspected  was true. The wicked Claudius had indeed killed his good brother the King, by dropping poison  into his ear as he slept in his orchard in the afternoon. </p>

<p><span class="w3-badge w3-red">4</span>"And you," said the ghost, "must avenge this cruel murder— on my wicked brother. But  do nothing against the Queen— for I have loved her, and she is your mother. Remember  me." Then seeing the morning approach, the ghost vanished.  "Now," said Hamlet, "there is nothing left but revenge. Remember thee — I will remember  nothing else—books, pleasure, youth—let all go—and your commands alone live on my  brain."  So when his friends <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox101" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> he made them swear to keep the secret of the ghost, and  then went in from the battlements, now gray with mingled dawn and moonlight, to think  how he might best avenge his murdered father.  The shock of seeing and hearing his father's ghost made him feel almost mad, and for fear  <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox102" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> might notice that he was not himself, he determined to hide his mad longing  for revenge under a pretended madness in other matters.  And when he met Ophelia, who loved him — and to whom he had given gifts, and letters, and  many loving words — he behaved so wildly to her, that she could not but think him mad.</p>

<p><span class="w3-badge w3-red">5</span> For she loved him so that <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox103" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> believe he would be as cruel as this, unless he were  quite mad. So she told her father, and showed him a pretty letter from Hamlet. And in the  letter was much folly, and this pretty verse—  "Doubt that the stars are fire; Doubt that the sun doth move;  Doubt truth to be a liar;  But never doubt I love."  And from that time everyone believed that the cause of Hamlet's supposed madness was love.  Poor Hamlet was very unhappy. He longed to obey his father's ghost—and yet he was too gentle and kindly to wish to kill another man, even his father's murderer. <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox104" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>  he wondered whether, after all, the ghost spoke truly.  Just at this time some actors came to the Court, and Hamlet ordered them to perform  a certain play before the King and Queen.</p>

<p><span class="w3-badge w3-red">6</span>Now, this play was the story of a man who  had been murdered in his garden by a near relation, who afterwards married the dead  man's wife.  <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox105" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> 
the feelings of the wicked King, as he sat on his throne, with the Queen  beside him and all his Court around, and saw, acted on the stage, the very wickedness that  he had himself done. And when, in the play, the wicked relation poured poison into the  ear of the sleeping man, the wicked Claudius suddenly rose, and staggered from the room — the  Queen and others following.  Then said Hamlet to his friends—  "Now I am sure the ghost spoke true. For if Claudius had not done this murder, he could  not have been so distressed to see it in a play."  Now the Queen sent for Hamlet, by the King's desire, to scold him for his conduct during  the play, and for other matters; and Claudius, wishing to know exactly
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox106" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>
 , told  old Polonius to hide himself behind the hangings in the Queen's room. And as they talked, the  Queen got frightened at Hamlet's rough, strange words, and cried for help, and Polonius behind  the curtain cried out too. Hamlet, thinking it was the King who was hidden there, thrust  with his sword at the hangings, and killed, not the King, but poor old Polonius.

    <p><span class="w3-badge w3-red">7</span>  So now Hamlet had offended his uncle and his mother, and by bad hap killed his true love's father. </p>   
      <p>"Oh! what a rash and bloody deed is this," cried the Queen.  And Hamlet answered bitterly, "Almost as bad as to kill a king, and marry his brother."
      <p>  Then Hamlet told the Queen plainly all his thoughts and how he knew of the murder, and  begged her, at least, <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox107" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> friendship or kindness of the base Claudius, who had killed the good King. And as they spoke the King's ghost again appeared before Hamlet,  but the Queen could not see it. So when the ghost had gone, they parted.  When the Queen told Claudius what had passed, and how Polonius was dead, he said, "This shows plainly that Hamlet is mad, and since he has killed the Chancellor, it is for his  own safety that we must carry out our plan, and send him away to England."  So Hamlet was sent, under charge of two courtiers who served the King, and these bore letters to the English Court, requiring that Hamlet should be put to death. But Hamlet <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox108" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> to get at these letters, and put in others instead, with the names of the two  courtiers who were so ready to betray him. Then, as the vessel went to England, Hamlet  escaped on board a pirate ship, and the two wicked courtiers left him to his fate, and went on to meet theirs. 
  Hamlet hurried home, but in the meantime a dreadful thing had happened. </p>

    <p><span class="w3-badge w3-red">8</span> Poor pretty Ophelia, 
      <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox109" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> lover and her father, lost her wits too, and went in sad madness about  the Court, with straws, and weeds, and flowers in her hair, singing strange scraps of songs, and talking poor, foolish, pretty talk with no heart of meaning to it. And one day, coming  to a stream where willows grew, she tried to bang a flowery garland on a willow, and  fell into the water with all her flowers, and so died.  <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox110" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> 
     loved her, though his plan of seeming madness had made him hide it; and when he came back, he found the King and Queen, and the Court, weeping at the funeral of his  dear love and lady.  Ophelia's brother, Laertes, had also just come to Court to ask justice for the death  of his father, old Polonius; and now, wild with grief, he leaped into his sister's grave, to clasp her in his arms once more. "I loved her more than forty thousand brothers," cried Hamlet, and leapt into the grave after him, and they fought till they were parted. Afterwards Hamlet begged Laertes to forgive him. "I could not bear," he said, "that any, even a brother, should seem to love her more than  I." </p>

Laertes challenged him to a fencing match, and all the Court were present. Hamlet had  the blunt foil always used in fencing, but Laertes had prepared for himself a sword, sharp, and tipped with poison. And the wicked King had made ready a bowl of poisoned wine,  which he meant to give poor Hamlet <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox112" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> grow warm with the sword play, and  should call for drink. 
      
      
      
      So Laertes and Hamlet fought, and Laertes, after some fencing, gave Hamlet a sharp sword  thrust. Hamlet, angry at this treachery—for they had been fencing, not as men fight, but  as they play—closed with Laertes in a struggle; both dropped their swords, and when they picked  them up again, Hamlet, without noticing it, had exchanged his own blunt sword for Laertes'  sharp and poisoned one. And with one thrust of it he pierced Laertes, <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox113" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> by  his own treachery. </p>

Hamlet, his heart at last being great enough to do the deed he ought, turned the poisoned  sword on the false King.  "Then — venom — do thy work!" he cried, and the King died.  So Hamlet in the end kept the promise he had made his father. And all being now accomplished,  he himself died. And those who stood by saw him die, with prayers and tears, for his friends  and 
      <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox116" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>  loved him with their whole hearts. Thus ends the tragic tale of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. End of Hamlet.</p>

<p>We use <span class="w3-myfont">tag questions </span>to check information and to ask for  confirmation. We form tag questions with auxiliary or modal verbs.<br>
  We generally use tag questions in spoken English.</p>
<p><br>
  1. When the statement is <strong>affirmative</strong>, the tag is  usually in the <strong>negative</strong>.<br>
  <blockquote class="w3-text-black">
  You’re Tom Cruise, aren’t you?<br>
  He speaks Russian, doesn’t he?</p>
  </blockquote>
<p>  2. When the statement is <strong>negative</strong>, the tag is usually  in the <strong>affirmative</strong>.<br>
<blockquote>
  <span class="w3-text-black">That’s not Julia Roberts, is it?<br>
  This doesn’t cost much, does it?</span><br>

It's captured the imagination of British people for centuries. Even today it's the place to go for tourists and druids.

Now, there are controversial plans to build a tunnel under the Stonehenge area. It's part of a big scheme to ease congestion.

The International Council on Monuments and Sites said it wants a solution that respects the value of this "unique" site.</p>

    <p><strong>Rob:</strong> Hello, I'm Rob…<br>
      
    <p><strong>Feifei:</strong> …and I'm Feifei and this is The <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox147" runat="server"></asp:TextBox><br>

<p><strong>Rob:</strong> Feifei, you've <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox148" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> all over the world <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox149" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> ever been to la-la land?<br>

<p><strong>Feifei:
</strong>Ha – you mean <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox150" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> – the city of angels. It's an <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox151" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>, full of <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox152" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>!<br>

<p><strong>Rob:</strong> Sounds great and you're <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox153" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> – la-la land is the <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox154" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> for Los Angeles… but there is another la-la land.<br>

<p><strong>Feifei:
</strong>And <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox155" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> this other la-la <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox156" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>?<br>

<p><strong>Rob:</strong> It's <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox157" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> in someone's head! Like <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox158" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> – he wants me <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox159" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> all these scripts, edit them and <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox160" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> a cup of tea – by the end of the day. He really <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox161" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> in la-la land!<br>

<p><strong>Feifei:</strong> Our boss is living in <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox162" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> – but <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox163" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> I checked he was living <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox164" runat="server"></asp:TextBox><br>

<p><strong>Rob:</strong> Well Feifei, <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox165" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> is living in la-la land <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox166" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> also mean they are in a fantasy world where <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox167" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> impossible things might happen – but they are being unreasonable and not being <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox168" runat="server"></asp:TextBox><br>

<p><strong>Feifei:</strong> <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox169" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> our boss.<br>

<p><strong>Rob:
</strong>Someone in la-la land doesn't really <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox170" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> how things really are – take a <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox171" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> these examples…<br>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong> <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox172" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> clearly living in la-la land – how can we ever afford <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox173" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> a house with the <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox174" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> we earn?<br>

<p><asp:TextBox ID="TextBox175" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>living in la-la land if he thinks <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox176" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> sailing with him – <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox177" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> seasick!<br>

<p><strong>Feifei:</strong> That's la-la land – a phrase to describe <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox178" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> who is unreasonable or out of <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox179" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> with reality. I know the <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox180" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> – I've got <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox181" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> to do too and <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox182" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> on holiday tomorrow… I don't suppose <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox183" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> help me?<br>

<p><strong>Rob:
</strong>Feifei you really <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox184" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> in la-la land – I've told you I haven't got <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox185" runat="server"></asp:TextBox><br>

<p><strong>Feifei:</strong> Ah well, <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox186" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> thought I'd ask.<br>

<p><strong>Rob:</strong> <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox187" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>, where are you off on <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox188" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> to this time?<br>

<p><strong>Feifei:</strong> <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox189" runat="server"></asp:TextBox> you guess?<br>

<p><strong>Rob:
</strong><asp:TextBox ID="TextBox190" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>?<br>

<p><strong>Both:
</strong><asp:TextBox ID="TextBox191" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>! <br>
