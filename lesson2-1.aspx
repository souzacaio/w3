<p align="center" class="w3-blue w3-xxlarge">INTERVIEW PART 1 - You’re hired! </p>
<p>Two words everybody loves to hear. But before we hear these words comes the interview. Today is part one in a series that’s all about preparing for a job interview.</p>

<p>Interviewing for a new job can be a huge source of stress and anxiety. And if you’re interviewing for a job in a non-native language, the stress can be even higher.  Throughout the interview, we’ll discuss some of the most common interview questions and how to answer them. You’ll also learn some basic information to get you started on creating your own answers to these questions. Let’s begin.</p>

<p>TK: Hello Ms. Smith, I’m Tom Kelley. Thanks so much for coming in.<br>
RS: It’s my pleasure, thanks so much for meeting with me.<br>
TK: Of course. Did you have any trouble finding the office?
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Small Talk. Most interviews will start out with a handshake and some small talk – this may include questions about how you’re doing, your travel to the interview, the weather, how your weekend went, and more. All you need to do is be polite and friendly. Keep your answers short. You can also feel free to turn the question back to the interviewer. For instance, if the interviewer asks you how your weekend was, you might respond, “It was great, we celebrated my Mom’s birthday. How was your weekend?” Small talk is used to build a more comfortable environment before the interview begins. It may seem silly, but you can practice small talk on your own by asking yourself simple, easy-to-answer, non-personal questions. You could also practice with a friend. Here is an example of small talk:</p>

 I’m great, thank you, and you?</p>
 <p>How are you doing?<br>
   I’m doing really well. It’s such a nice day out there.<br>
   It is! It was perfect weather all weekend.<br>
   It was.</p>

   Yes, I went to the park with my family for a picnic.<br>

   It does feel good to get work done!

 <p>You can see we haven’t said much of importance, but the conversation is friendly and open, and can make two people feel more comfortable in each other’s presence.</p>

</div>

<p>  Common Question: </p>
<p>Tell me a little bit about yourself. It’s very common for interviewers to simply ask you to tell them about yourself. That can feel overwhelming! But don’t worry; what they really want you to focus on is your education and work history. You can also let them know what areas you have a lot of experience in, or what your interests are when answering this question. Here are a few different ways to begin your answer.</p>

<p>  I studied at Harvard University and graduated 2012 with a degree in business.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p></p>
<p>If you’re preparing for an interview, practice talking about yourself and your work history. Record yourself with a video camera if possible. Make sure it’s not too long, maybe around a minute. Go back and listen or watch, and write down phrases that worked well to use again. If there was anything you stumbled over or left out, write down some possible phrases you could have used. </p>
<p> It’s important that you don’t just write a paragraph and memorize it, but simply practice free-talking with some key phrases. The more you practice before the interview, the more comfortable you’ll feel answering the questions during the interview.</p>

<p>TK: So, to get started, why don’t you tell me a little bit about yourself.  </p>


<p>RS: Sure. I studied at the University of Florida and graduated in 2010 with a Masters Degree in Toy Design. After graduation, I was hired at Happy Kid’s Creative. I’ve been there for the past five years and am currently the Director of Toy Production. During that time sales have grown steadily. It’s been a great experience, but I’ve run out of room to grow with HKC and I’m looking for new opportunities. I have a lot of experience leading teams in the creative process and finding new markets for the products that we create.</p>

<p align="center" class="w3-blue w3-xxlarge">INTERVIEW PART 2 - You’re hired! </p>

<p>This is part two of a five-part series on preparing for an interview. Interviewing for a job can be a huge source of stress and anxiety. And if you’re interviewing for a job in a non-native language, the stress can be even higher.  Throughout the interview, we’ll discuss some of the most common interview questions and how to answer them. You’ll also learn some basic information to get you started creating your own answers to these questions.</p>
<p class="w3-light-blue">  TK: That’s great. Can you tell me how you heard about this position?</p>

<p></p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox39" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>
<p></p>


<p>  Can you tell me how you heard 
  
  about this position? This is a common question that you’ll hear in interviews. It’s a chance to share a little bit about the research that you’ve done in order to learn about the position you are applying for. It’s also a chance to share if someone from inside the company let you know about the position. Here are some example responses:</p>
<p>  

<p></p>
<audio controls>
    <source src="audio/doubts/part2-1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
<p></p>

  I heard about the position from one of your current employees, Bob Greene.<br>
  I heard about the position from my friend Liz Miller, who works in Accounting.  <br>
  I saw this position on LinkedIn.<br>
  I read about the position on your website.</p>
  
<p>  Since this is a simple question with a simple answer, think about your answer and practice it out loud before your interview. Record yourself and listen. </p>

<p><asp:TextBox ID="TextBox40" runat="server"></asp:TextBox></p>


 <p>Are you easy to understand? 
 
 <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox41" runat="server"></asp:TextBox></p>
 
<p>Are there any words that are challenging for you? 

<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox42" runat="server"></asp:TextBox></p>


<p></p>
<div class="w3-container">
  <div align="right"><h1 class="w3-text-red" style="text-shadow:1px 1px 0 #444"><b>EXERCISES

class="w3-btn w3-grey hover-lime" style="width:60%" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<p>  Practice these words separately, slowly, thinking about the mouth position. As it becomes more comfortable, speed it up. You’re going to want to practice tough words 10, 20, 30 times in a row. Build your muscle memory, so in the interview it will naturally be easier to pronounce.</p>

<p></p>


<p>  TK: That’s great. Can you tell me how you heard about this position?  </p>
<p>RS: Of course. A friend of mine saw the position listed on LinkedIn and forwarded it to me, so I spent some time on your website learning about the position and the company. I also read an article in Business Weekly about your work that really got me interested.</p>
<p><br>

<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox43" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>

  <p>TK: What attracted you to our company?</p>
<p>  Common Question: </p>
<p class="w3-light-blue">What attracted you to our company? </p>
<p>This question gives you the opportunity to share what you know about the company, and why you would like to work there. Some ways to begin your response include the following. Notice that most responses show that you have a strong feeling about what you learned. This will give the interviewer more information about who you are and what you might bring to the position.</p>

<p>  
  I was really impressed with your commitment to renewable energy.<br>
  I was very excited to learn that you support your research department so strongly.<br>
  I read that you encourage employees to spend time with each other outside the workplace, and that is something I really appreciate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
<p>Again, think about the answer to this question before your interview, and practice your responses using recordings and repetition. Even if this question is not asked, the time spent practicing the response will be helpful when you answer other questions during the interview.</p>

I also like the support you provide for your employees. I love your continuing education initiatives, where you pay for employees to educate themselves in new techniques and skill sets. I think that really helps to build employee satisfaction and loyalty.</p>

  <p class="w3-light-blue">    TK: You’ve obviously done your homework. What would you say is your greatest strength?</p>
  <p>    Common Question: </p>
  <p class="w3-light-blue">What would you say is your greatest strength? </p>
  <p>This question gives you the chance to talk about what you do really well as an employee, and as a person. You can share what your greatest strength is, then explain how that helps you in your current job or life. For example:</p>
<p>  My greatest strength is _________. I find that this is very important when I _______.</p>
  <p>My greatest strength is flexibility. I find that this is very important when I’m working with lots of different people and opinions.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>    To practice answering this question, write down: </p>
  <p>My greatest strength is (blank). Then, fill in your strength. Write down how this strength is demonstrated in your life and work. You may come up with several different strengths you want to highlight. That’s great, practice them all. But in the interview, you’ll only want to use one or two answers. Practice answering the questions out loud, based on what you wrote down. But don’t just memorize written text. Practice speaking freely on these ideas.</p>

<p class="w3-light-blue">  TK: What would you say is your greatest strength?</p>
  <p>RS: I would say, my greatest strength is a combination of enthusiasm and persistence. My work ethic won’t let me settle for less than my best. I’m able to persevere through challenges and setbacks without falling into frustration or anger. I’ve noticed that this tends to keep those around me in good spirits as well, which is a plus.</p>

<p align="center" class="w3-blue w3-xxlarge">INTERVIEW PART 3 - You’re hired! </p>

<p>This is part three of a five-part series on preparing for an interview. Interviewing for a new job can be a huge source of stress and anxiety. If you’re interviewing for a job in a non-native language, the stress can be even higher. In this video you will see me interview for a job. Throughout the interview, we’ll discuss some of the most common interview questions and how to answer them. You’ll also learn some basic information to get you started creating your own answers to these questions. Let’s pick up where we left off in the previous video.</p>
<p>  TK: Can you tell me about a time where you suffered a setback and had to maintain your enthusiasm?</p>
<p>  Common Question:</p>
<p> Can you tell me about a time when you suffered a setback and had to maintain your enthusiasm? The interviewer may ask questions like this to get a better sense of how you behave and perform in certain stressful situations. The question may be about your actual past experiences, or a hypothetical situation, to see how you would respond. Here are examples of other questions that are similar to this one:</p>
<p>  Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a difficult client or coworker.  </p>
<p>Tell me about a time when you had to respond to a crisis.</p>
<p>  Tell me about a time when you had to give difficult feedback.</p>
<p>  How would you handle a situation where you and your supervisor disagreed about an issue or course of action?</p>
<p>  You can see, there’s a lot of variety in the kind of way question is asked, so it’s impossible to know exactly what you might need to say. In the days leading up to your interview, practice responding to several different versions of this question every day. This will help build important vocabulary you might need in the interview, and will also help you feel ready to answer questions like these.  </p>
<p>TK: Can you tell me about a time where you suffered a setback and had to maintain your enthusiasm?</p>
<p>  RS: Sure. One definitely comes to mind. Last year a project for a new toy was in its final stages after two years of work. As we were looking at the branding and working up a final marketing plan, a competitor launched a version of the exact same toy that we were launching. As the leader of the project, I knew that my reaction would set the tone for the group. I acknowledged that it was a setback, but challenged the group to think of this as a blessing in disguise. I asked them to go out and buy the competitor’s product and make a list of anything they wished the toy could do that it didn’t. It turned out that the list was pretty long. We added these items to our toy, and launched a far superior product 6 months later. So, in many ways, the competitor’s product became the key to our success.</p>

<p></p>



<p>  TK: That sounds like a great victory. Now. What would you consider your greatest weakness?</p>
<p>  Common Question: </p>
<p>What do you consider to be your greatest weakness? </p>
<p>This question can be a tough one. You want to be as honest as possible when answering this question. This is an opportunity to show a future employer that you know yourself, and are willing to work to improve yourself. Share a weakness, like public speaking, or attention to detail, fear of failure. And then talk about ways you’ve worked on improvement in that area. Here is a way to start a response:</p>
<p>  My greatest weakness is ___.<br>
  It shows up in my work when __.<br>
  The ways I’ve worked to improve in this area are __.</p>
  
  <p></p>
  <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox51" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>
  
  <p></p>
<p>  Take a moment to think about something you’ve struggled with in your work life. Think of ways that you’ve worked to improve, any books that you’ve read, classes you’ve taken, and so on. These are the things you want to share with the interviewer when answering this question. </p>
<p>Remember, the important thing is to show that you are aware of your weak spots – and that you are already working at improving in these areas.</p>
<p>  TK: Now, what do you consider to be your biggest weakness?<br>
  RS: Chocolate. Just kidding! No, my biggest weakness is public speaking. It’s something that I’ve spent a lot of time working on and in which I’ve improved a great deal. I’m very comfortable in smaller meetings with my teams. But when I present an idea or concept to a larger audience, I still experience some stage fright. At this point, I can handle these situations professionally, but I would like to be more comfort in these moments so I can really enjoy the experience of presenting, rather than just survive it.</p>
  
  <p></p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox52" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>
<p></p>



  <p>TK: Fear of public speaking is a very common fear; I’m in the same boat on that one!

<p align="center" class="w3-blue w3-xxlarge">INTERVIEW PART 4 - You’re hired! </p>
             
<p>This is part four of a five-part series on preparing for an interview. Interviewing for a new job can be a huge source of stress and anxiety. And if you’re interviewing for a job in a non-native language, the stress can be even higher. In this video you’ll see me interview for a job. Throughout the interview, we’ll discuss some of the most common interview questions and how to answer them. You’ll also learn some basic information to get you started creating your own answers to these questions. Let’s pick up where we left off in the previous video.</p>
<p>  TK: Where do you see yourself in five years?</p>
<p>  Common Question: </p>
<p>Where do you see yourself in five years? This is a chance to share your goals for the future. You want to demonstrate that you understand what is realistically achievable over a certain period of time. You’ll also be letting the interviewer know how ambitious you are with this answer. If you haven’t thought about this question at all, it can be a great idea to think about this before your interview. Also, think about answers to two variations: where do you see yourself in one year, where do you see yourself in 10 years.
  You start this response by saying:</p>
<p>  In five years I would like to be ___.</p>

<p></p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox53" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>
<p></p>

<p>  Practice answering this question out loud as you prepare for your interview. If you only practice your answers in your head, it will be much more stressful when you’re in the room with the interviewer, speaking out loud for the first time. Record yourself. Critique your own speech. What was unclear? How you can you clarify, or say more concisely, your thoughts?</p>
<p>  TK: Where do you see yourself in five years?<br>
  RS: As I mentioned before, I’m interested in growth. In five years I would like to be a part of a company growing its business on a regular and consistent basis. I’d like to be in a Vice President position with a focus on development. And while I know that would require much more public speaking, in five years I plan on being ready for it.</p>

<p><br>
  TK: Okay, well, I have everything I need, but do you have any questions for me, about the company or the position?</p>
<p>  Common Question: </p>
<p>Do you have any questions for me? So far, the interview has been about whether or not you would be a good fit for the company. With the question “Do you have any questions for me?”, it’s your turn to find out if the company is a good fit for you. The questions you ask will also show how well you know their company and the requirements of the position.</p>
<p>  Before the interview, write down any questions you have about the position, the company, or the work environment. Then practice those questions out loud. Chances are, you won’t need to ask all of them. Some might be answered during the earlier parts of the interview.</p>
<p class="w3-light-grey">  TK: Okay, well, I have everything I need, but do you have any questions for me, about the company or the position?<p>RS: Yes. Imagine you’re looking back on this hiring decision in a year. The person you hired has exceeded your expectations. What did he or she do that impressed you most?<br>
  <p class="w3-light-grey">TK: That’s a great question. I think in one year the person would have come in and spent some time learning from the team and people that have been here a while. Then, she or he will start making changes in an informed way. In one year I want this person’s team to be a well-oiled machine. I want them to be bouncing ideas off each other, coming up with new designs and making headway into new markets.</p>
  <p>RS: That’s helpful. It’s good to know what the expectations are. Can you tell me about the team that I would be working with?<br>
  <p class="w3-light-grey">TK: Sure. I believe all of them have been with the company for over five years and know the ropes. I would say there’s a little bit of frustration currently because of our lack of growth. This will be the third time we’ve brought in a new team leader in four years.</p>
  RS: Do you know what’s causing that kind of rapid turn over?<br>
  <p class="w3-light-grey">TK: To be honest, the last three team leaders have been hired from within the company. And sometimes it’s hard to think outside the box when you’ve been inside the box for awhile. We’re hoping to bring in some new ideas and energy and get our development team back on track.</p>
  <p>RS: That makes sense. I really appreciate that you’re considering me for the position. I’d love to be a part of the company achieving its goals.<br>
  <p class="w3-light-grey">TK: Very good. Okay. That’s great, thanks so much for coming in, Rachel. It’s great to meet you. I’ll give you a call in the next three days.</p>
  <p>RS: Sounds good, I look forward to it. Thanks again.<br>
  <p class="w3-light-grey">TK: My pleasure.</p>
<p>  Notice that the interview ends with another handshake. You may have some more small talk at the end of the interview as well. Hopefully by the end of the interview you feel more comfortable and confident than you did when you arrived.
  There’s just one video left in this series. In that video, we’ll talk about things like body language, humor, and expression and how to use them to your advantage in an interview.
</p>


 <p align="center" class="w3-blue w3-xxlarge">INTERVIEW PART 5 - You’re hired! </p>

<p>First, let’s look at the complete mock interview from the series. What do you notice about how I present myself, and the interviewer? What do our postures and facial expressions say to you?</p>
<p class="w3-light-grey">  TK: Hello Ms. Smith, I’m Tom Kelley. Thanks so much for coming in.</p>
  RS: It’s my pleasure, thanks so much for meeting with me.<br>
<p class="w3-light-grey">  TK: Of course. Did you have any trouble finding the office?</p>
  RS: Nope. The directions on the website were great.<br>
<p class="w3-light-grey">  TK: Good. Would you like some water or coffee before we begin?</p>
  RS: I’m okay, thank you.<br>
<p class="w3-light-grey">  TK: Alright. So, to get started, why don’t you tell me a little bit about yourself.</p>
  RS: Sure. I studied at the University of Florida and graduated in 2010 with a Masters Degree in Toy Design. After graduation, I was hired at Happy Kid’s Creative. I’ve been there for the past five years and am currently the Director of Toy Production. During that time sales have grown steadily. It’s been a great experience, but I’ve run out of room to grow with HKC and I’m looking for new opportunities. I have a lot of experience leading teams in the creative process and finding new markets for the products that we create.<br>
<p class="w3-light-grey">  TK: That’s great. Can you tell me how you heard about this position?</p>
  RS: Of course. A friend of mine saw the position listed on LinkedIn and forwarded it to me, so I spent some time on your website learning about the position and the company. I also read an article in Business Weekly about your work that really got me interested.<br>
<p class="w3-light-grey">  TK: What attracted you to our company?</p>
  RS: To be honest, what really caught my eye was your focus on growth. I was really impressed with your ambitious goals and the clear plan you have for achieving those goals. I also like the support you provide for your employees. I love your continuing education initiatives, where you pay for employees to educate themselves in new techniques and skill sets. I think that really helps to build employee satisfaction and loyalty.<br>
<p class="w3-light-grey">  TK: You’ve obviously done your homework. What would you say is your greatest strength?</p>
  RS: I would say, my greatest strength is a combination of enthusiasm and persistence. My work ethic won’t let me settle for less than my best. I’m able to persevere through challenges and setbacks without falling into frustration or anger. I’ve noticed that this tends to keep those around me in good spirits as well, which is a plus.<br>
<p class="w3-light-grey">  TK: That’s very good. Can you tell me about a time where you suffered a setback and had to maintain your enthusiasm?</p>

  RS: Sounds good, I look forward to it. Thanks again.<br>
<p class="w3-light-grey">  TK: My pleasure.</p>
  First let’s talk about the handshake. A long time ago, women used to shake hands more like this. But now, men and women alike use the same handshake, putting your right hand forward. Make it firm but not too tight or aggressive. A firm handshake makes a good first impression.<br>
<p class="w3-light-grey">  TK: Hello Ms. Smith, I’m Tom Kelley. Thanks so much for coming in.</p>
  RS: It’s my pleasure, thanks so much for meeting with me.<br>
<p class="w3-light-grey">  TK: Of course.</p>
<p>  Let’s look at my posture.<br>
  It’s good to sit upright and look alert. You don’t want to slump back or slouch, that’s a bit too casual for a job interview.<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Questions</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. Can you tell me a little about yourself?<br>
This question seems simple, so many people fail to prepare for it, but it's crucial. Here's the deal: Don't give your complete employment (or personal) history. Instead give a pitch—one that’s concise and compelling and that shows exactly why you’re the right fit for the job. Start off with the 2-3 specific accomplishments or experiences that you most want the interviewer to know about, then wrap up talking about how that prior experience has positioned you for this specific role.
</p>
<p></p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox61" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox62" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>2. How did you hear about the position?<br>
Another seemingly innocuous interview question, this is actually a perfect opportunity to stand out and show your passion for and connection to the company. For example, if you found out about the gig through a friend or professional contact, name drop that person, then share why you were so excited about it. If you discovered the company through an event or article, share that. Even if you found the listing through a random job board, share what, specifically, caught your eye about the role.
</p>

<p></p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox63" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox64" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>3. What do you know about the company?<br>
Any candidate can read and regurgitate the company’s “About” page. So, when interviewers ask this, they aren't necessarily trying to gauge whether you understand the mission—they want to know whether you care about it. Start with one line that shows you understand the company's goals, using a couple key words and phrases from the website, but then go on to make it personal. Say, “I’m personally drawn to this mission because…” or “I really believe in this approach because…” and share a personal example or two.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>4. Why do you want this job?<br>
Again, companies want to hire people who are passionate about the job, so you should have a great answer about why you want the position. (And if you don't? You probably should apply elsewhere.) First, identify a couple of key factors that make the role a great fit for you (e.g., “I love customer support because I love the constant human interaction and the satisfaction that comes from helping someone solve a problem"), then share why you love the company (e.g., “I’ve always been passionate about education, and I think you guys are doing great things, so I want to be a part of it”).

<p>5. Why should we hire you?<br>
This interview question seems forward (not to mention intimidating!), but if you're asked it, you're in luck: There's no better setup for you to sell yourself and your skills to the hiring manager. Your job here is to craft an answer that covers three things: that you can not only do the work, you can deliver great results; that you'll really fit in with the team and culture; and that you'd be a better hire than any of the other candidates.

<p>6. What are your greatest professional strengths?<br>
When answering this question, interview coach Pamela Skillings recommends being accurate (share your true strengths, not those you think the interviewer wants to hear); relevant (choose your strengths that are most targeted to this particular position); and specific (for example, instead of “people skills,” choose “persuasive communication” or “relationship building”). Then, follow up with an example of how you've demonstrated these traits in a professional setting.
</p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox71" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>

<p></p>

<p>7. What do you consider to be your weaknesses?<br>
What your interviewer is really trying to do with this question—beyond identifying any major red flags—is to gauge your self-awareness and honesty. So, “I can't meet a deadline to save my life” is not an option—but neither is “Nothing! I'm perfect!” Strike a balance by thinking of something that you struggle with but that you’re working to improve. For example, maybe you’ve never been strong at public speaking, but you've recently volunteered to run meetings to help you be more comfortable when addressing a crowd.
</p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox72" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>


<p></p>
<p>8. What is your greatest professional achievement?<br>
Nothing says “hire me” better than a track record of achieving amazing results in past jobs, so don't be shy when answering this interview question! A great way to do so is by using the S-T-A-R method: Set up the situation and the task that you were required to complete to provide the interviewer with background context (e.g., “In my last job as a junior analyst, it was my role to manage the invoicing process”), but spend the bulk of your time describing what you actually did (the action) and what you achieved (the result). For example, “In one month, I streamlined the process, which saved my group 10 man-hours each month and reduced errors on invoices by 25%.”
</p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox73" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>

<p></p>
<p>9. Tell me about a challenge or conflict you've faced at work, and how you dealt with it.<br>
In asking this interview question, “your interviewer wants to get a sense of how you will respond to conflict. Anyone can seem nice and pleasant in a job interview, but what will happen if you’re hired and Gladys in Compliance starts getting in your face?” says Skillings. Again, you'll want to use the S-T-A-R method, being sure to focus on how you handled the situation professionally and productively, and ideally closing with a happy ending, like how you came to a resolution or compromise.
</p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox74" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>

<p></p>
<p>10. Where do you see yourself in five years?<br>
If asked this question, be honest and specific about your future goals, but consider this: A hiring manager wants to know a) if you've set realistic expectations for your career, b) if you have ambition (a.k.a., this interview isn't the first time you're considering the question), and c) if the position aligns with your goals and growth. Your best bet is to think realistically about where this position could take you and answer along those lines. And if the position isn’t necessarily a one-way ticket to your aspirations? It’s OK to say that you’re not quite sure what the future holds, but that you see this experience playing an important role in helping you make that decision.
</p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox75" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>


<p></p>
<p>11. What's your dream job?<br>
Along similar lines, the interviewer wants to uncover whether this position is really in line with your ultimate career goals. While “an NBA star” might get you a few laughs, a better bet is to talk about your goals and ambitions—and why this job will get you closer to them.
</p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox76" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>

<p></p>
<p>12. What other companies are you interviewing with?<br>
Companies ask this for a number of reasons, from wanting to see what the competition is for you to sniffing out whether you're serious about the industry. “Often the best approach is to mention that you are exploring a number of other similar options in the company's industry,” says job search expert Alison Doyle. “It can be helpful to mention that a common characteristic of all the jobs you are applying to is the opportunity to apply some critical abilities and skills that you possess. For example, you might say 'I am applying for several positions with IT consulting firms where I can analyze client needs and translate them to development teams in order to find solutions to technology problems.'”
</p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox77" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>

<p></p>
<p>13. Why are you leaving your current job?<br>
This is a toughie, but one you can be sure you'll be asked. Definitely keep things positive—you have nothing to gain by being negative about your past employers. Instead, frame things in a way that shows that you're eager to take on new opportunities and that the role you’re interviewing for is a better fit for you than your current or last position. For example, “I’d really love to be part of product development from beginning to end, and I know I’d have that opportunity here.” And if you were let go? Keep it simple: “Unfortunately, I was let go,” is a totally OK answer.
</p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox78" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>

<p></p>
<p>14. Why were you fired?<br>
OK, if you get the admittedly much tougher follow-up question as to why you were let go (and the truth isn't exactly pretty), your best bet is to be honest (the job-seeking world is small, after all). But it doesn't have to be a deal-breaker. Share how you’ve grown and how you approach your job and life now as a result. If you can position the learning experience as an advantage for this next job, even better.
</p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox79" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>

<p></p>
<p>15. What are you looking for in a new position?<br>
Hint: Ideally the same things that this position has to offer. Be specific.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>16. What type of work environment do you prefer?<br>
Hint: Ideally one that's similar to the environment of the company you're applying to. Be specific.
</p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox80" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>

<p></p>
<p>17. What's your management style?<br>
The best managers are strong but flexible, and that's exactly what you want to show off in your answer. (Think something like, “While every situation and every team member requires a bit of a different strategy, I tend to approach my employee relationships as a coach...”) Then, share a couple of your best managerial moments, like when you grew your team from five to 15 or coached an underperforming employee to become the company's top salesperson.
</p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox81" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>

<p></p>
<p>18. What's a time you exercised leadership?<br>
Depending on what's more important for the the role, you'll want to choose an example that showcases your project management skills (spearheading a project from end to end, juggling multiple moving parts) or one that shows your ability to confidently and effectively rally a team. And remember: “The best stories include enough detail to be believable and memorable,” says Skillings. “Show how you were a leader in this situation and how it represents your overall leadership experience and potential.”
</p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox82" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>

<p></p>
<p>19. What's a time you disagreed with a decision that was made at work?<br>
Everyone disagrees with the boss from time to time, but in asking this interview question, hiring managers want to know that you can do so in a productive, professional way. “You don’t want to tell the story about the time when you disagreed but your boss was being a jerk and you just gave in to keep the peace. And you don’t want to tell the one where you realized you were wrong,” says Peggy McKee of Career Confidential. “Tell the one where your actions made a positive difference on the outcome of the situation, whether it was a work-related outcome or a more effective and productive working relationship.”
</p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox83" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>

<p></p>
<p>20. How would your boss and co-workers describe you?<br>
First of all, be honest (remember, if you get this job, the hiring manager will be calling your former bosses and co-workers!). Then, try to pull out strengths and traits you haven't discussed in other aspects of the interview, such as your strong work ethic or your willingness to pitch in on other projects when needed.
</p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox84" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>

<p></p>
<p>21. Why was there a gap in your employment?<br>
If you were unemployed for a period of time, be direct and to the point about what you’ve been up to (and hopefully, that’s a litany of impressive volunteer and other mind-enriching activities, like blogging or taking classes). Then, steer the conversation toward how you will do the job and contribute to the organization: “I decided to take a break at the time, but today I’m ready to contribute to this organization in the following ways.”
</p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox85" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>

<p></p>
<p>22. Can you explain why you changed career paths?<br>
Don't be thrown off by this question—just take a deep breath and explain to the hiring manager why you've made the career decisions you have. More importantly, give a few examples of how your past experience is transferrable to the new role. This doesn't have to be a direct connection; in fact, it's often more impressive when a candidate can make seemingly irrelevant experience seem very relevant to the role.
</p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox86" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>

<p></p>
<p>23. How do you deal with pressure or stressful situations?<br>
"Choose an answer that shows that you can meet a stressful situation head-on in a productive, positive manner and let nothing stop you from accomplishing your goals," says McKee. A great approach is to talk through your go-to stress-reduction tactics (making the world's greatest to-do list, stopping to take 10 deep breaths), and then share an example of a stressful situation you navigated with ease.
</p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox87" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>

<p></p>
<p>24. What would your first 30, 60, or 90 days look like in this role?<br>
Start by explaining what you'd need to do to get ramped up. What information would you need? What parts of the company would you need to familiarize yourself with? What other employees would you want to sit down with? Next, choose a couple of areas where you think you can make meaningful contributions right away. (e.g., “I think a great starter project would be diving into your email marketing campaigns and setting up a tracking system for them.”) Sure, if you get the job, you (or your new employer) might decide there’s a better starting place, but having an answer prepared will show the interviewer where you can add immediate impact—and that you’re excited to get started.
</p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox88" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>

<p></p>
<p>25. What are your salary requirements?<br>
The #1 rule of answering this question is doing your research on what you should be paid by using sites like Payscale and Glassdoor. You’ll likely come up with a range, and we recommend stating the highest number in that range that applies, based on your experience, education, and skills. Then, make sure the hiring manager knows that you're flexible. You're communicating that you know your skills are valuable, but that you want the job and are willing to negotiate.
</p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox89" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>

<p></p>
<p>26. What do you like to do outside of work?<br>
Interviewers ask personal questions in an interview to “see if candidates will fit in with the culture [and] give them the opportunity to open up and display their personality, too,” says longtime hiring manager Mitch Fortner. “In other words, if someone asks about your hobbies outside of work, it’s totally OK to open up and share what really makes you tick. (Do keep it semi-professional, though: Saying you like to have a few beers at the local hot spot on Saturday night is fine. Telling them that Monday is usually a rough day for you because you’re always hungover is not.)”
</p>
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox90" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>

<p></p>
<p>27. If you were an animal, which one would you want to be?<br>
Seemingly random personality-test type questions like these come up in interviews generally because hiring managers want to see how you can think on your feet. There's no wrong answer here, but you'll immediately gain bonus points if your answer helps you share your strengths or personality or connect with the hiring manager. Pro tip: Come up with a stalling tactic to buy yourself some thinking time, such as saying, “Now, that is a great question. I think I would have to say… ”
</p>
<p></p>
<p>28. How many tennis balls can you fit into a limousine?<br>
1,000? 10,000? 100,000? Seriously?<br>
Well, seriously, you might get asked brainteaser questions like these, especially in quantitative jobs. But remember that the interviewer doesn’t necessarily want an exact number—he wants to make sure that you understand what’s being asked of you, and that you can set into motion a systematic and logical way to respond. So, just take a deep breath, and start thinking through the math. (Yes, it’s OK to ask for a pen and paper!)
</p>
<p></p>
<p>29. Are you planning on having children?<br>
Questions about your family status, gender (“How would you handle managing a team of all men?”), nationality (“Where were you born?”), religion, or age, are illegal—but they still get asked (and frequently). Of course, not always with ill intent—the interviewer might just be trying to make conversation—but you should definitely tie any questions about your personal life (or anything else you think might be inappropriate) back to the job at hand. For this question, think: “You know, I’m not quite there yet. But I am very interested in the career paths at your company. Can you tell me more about that?”
</p>
<p></p>
<p>30.  
This is a common one at startups (and one of our personal favorites here at The Muse). Hiring managers want to know that you not only have some background on the company, but that you're able to think critically about it and come to the table with new ideas. So, come with new ideas! What new features would you love to see? How could the company increase conversions? How could customer service be improved? You don’t need to have the company’s four-year strategy figured out, but do share your thoughts, and more importantly, show how your interests and expertise would lend themselves to the job.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>31. Do you have any questions for us?<br>
You probably already know that an interview isn't just a chance for a hiring manager to grill you—it's your opportunity to sniff out whether a job is the right fit for you. What do you want to know about the position?  The company?  The department?  The team?
You'll cover a lot of this in the actual interview, so have a few less-common questions ready to go. We especially like questions targeted to the interviewer (“What's your favorite part about working here?") or the company's growth (“What can you tell me about your new products or plans for growth?")
